Load pickled pandas object (or any object) from file.

.. warning::

   Loading pickled data received from untrusted sources can be
   unsafe. See `here <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`__.

Parameters
----------
filepath_or_buffer : str, path object, or file-like object
    String, path object (implementing ``os.PathLike[str]``), or file-like
    object implementing a binary ``readlines()`` function.
    Also accepts URL. URL is not limited to S3 and GCS.

compression : str or dict, default 'infer'
    For on-the-fly decompression of on-disk data. If 'infer' and 'filepath_or_buffer' is
    path-like, then detect compression from the following extensions: '.gz',
    '.bz2', '.zip', '.xz', '.zst', '.tar', '.tar.gz', '.tar.xz' or '.tar.bz2'
    (otherwise no compression).
    If using 'zip' or 'tar', the ZIP file must contain only one data file to be read in.
    Set to ``None`` for no decompression.
    Can also be a dict with key ``'method'`` set
    to one of {``'zip'``, ``'gzip'``, ``'bz2'``, ``'zstd'``, ``'xz'``, ``'tar'``} and
    other key-value pairs are forwarded to
    ``zipfile.ZipFile``, ``gzip.GzipFile``,
    ``bz2.BZ2File``, ``zstandard.ZstdDecompressor``, ``lzma.LZMAFile`` or
    ``tarfile.TarFile``, respectively.
    As an example, the following could be passed for Zstandard decompression using a
    custom compression dictionary:
    ``compression={'method': 'zstd', 'dict_data': my_compression_dict}``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.5.0
        Added support for `.tar` files.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0 Zstandard support.

storage_options : dict, optional
    Extra options that make sense for a particular storage connection, e.g.
    host, port, username, password, etc. For HTTP(S) URLs the key-value pairs
    are forwarded to ``urllib.request.Request`` as header options. For other
    URLs (e.g. starting with "s3://", and "gcs://") the key-value pairs are
    forwarded to ``fsspec.open``. Please see ``fsspec`` and ``urllib`` for more
    details, and for more examples on storage options refer `here
    <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html?
    highlight=storage_options#reading-writing-remote-files>`_.

Returns
-------
same type as object stored in file

See Also
--------
DataFrame.to_pickle : Pickle (serialize) DataFrame object to file.
Series.to_pickle : Pickle (serialize) Series object to file.
read_hdf : Read HDF5 file into a DataFrame.
read_sql : Read SQL query or database table into a DataFrame.
read_parquet : Load a parquet object, returning a DataFrame.

Notes
-----
read_pickle is only guaranteed to be backwards compatible to pandas 0.20.3
provided the object was serialized with to_pickle.
